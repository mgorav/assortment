    "# Health Insurance Claim Processing with Advanced Machine Learning and AI\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the application of advanced machine learning and generative AI techniques in automating health insurance claim processing. The aim is to efficiently and accurately process claims by examining the combinatorial relationships between procedures and diagnoses codes.\n",

    "- To preprocess health insurance claim data.\n",
    "- To engineer features that capture the essential aspects of insurance claims.\n",
    "- To select, train, and evaluate machine learning models suited for predicting claim approvals.\n",
    "- To discuss potential deployment strategies for integrating the model into a production environment.\n",
